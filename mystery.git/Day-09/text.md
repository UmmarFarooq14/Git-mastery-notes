Concept of git stash:
---------------------
--> git stash is used to temporarily save your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) so you can switch branches or work on something else without committing.

Why Use Stash:
-------------
--> when you need to switch branches quickly without committing.
--> When you want to save work in progress temporarily.
--> keep your commit history clean.

Common Commands:
---------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Command                | Description                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `git stash`            | Save your changes and clear working directory.    |
| `git stash save "msg"` | Save with a message (optional in newer Git).      |
| `git stash list`       | Show all saved stashes.                           |
| `git stash apply`      | Apply the latest stash but keep it in stash list. |
| `git stash pop`        | Apply the latest stash and remove it from list.   |
| `git stash drop`       | Delete a specific stash.                          |
| `git stash clear`      | Remove all stashes.                               |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual Idea:
-----------

[ Working Directory with Changes ] 
           |
        git stash
           v
[ Changes saved in stash stack, directory clean ]
           |
        git stash pop
           v
[ Changes restored from stash stack ]




Concept of git pull, git fetch and git merge:
---------------------------------------------


Git fetch:
----------

--> It Fetch the updated data from remote repository to local repository and it merge in local repository but doesn't change working directory or current branch.
--> Think of it as checking for updates.

command:
-------
  git fetch origin.

Git merge:
----------
--> Combines changes from one branch to another branch.
--> We can use it after fetching or switching a branch.

command:
--------
  git merge origin/main.

Git pull:
---------
--> A shortcut from git fetch + git merge in one command.
--> It downloads new changes and immediately merges them into your current branch.

command:
--------
  git pull origin main.
